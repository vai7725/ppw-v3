# My MERN Stack Question Paper Website - 'https://previouspapers.netlify.app'

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. It is designed to provide students with access to previous year question papers from various universities. This project serves as an important addition to my resume, showcasing my skills in web development.

## Active User Community

One of the most significant achievements of this project is its active and engaged user community. My website has gained popularity among students, especially my college mates, who rely on it during exam times. The user base continues to grow, and the website plays a crucial role in their academic preparation.

## Dynamic Paper Selection and Filtering

One of the standout features of my website is the dynamic paper selection and filtering system. When users select a university, the website dynamically fetches all the available question papers from the database. This ensures that students have easy access to a wealth of academic resources at their fingertips.
